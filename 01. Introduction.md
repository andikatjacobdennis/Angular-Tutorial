## 1. Introduction  

### What is Angular?  
Angular is a **popular open-source framework** developed and maintained by Google, specifically designed for creating **dynamic, responsive, and modern web applications**. Angular stands out because it uses **TypeScript**, a superset of JavaScript, which ensures robust code, better tooling, and easier debugging. With Angular, you can build **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** where the content dynamically updates without requiring a full page reload, offering a smooth and fast user experience.

### Why Use Angular?  
Angular is a preferred choice for many developers and organizations for several reasons:  

1. **Component-Based Architecture**  
   Angular applications are built using components, which encapsulate HTML, CSS, and TypeScript code. This modular approach makes the code **reusable**, **testable**, and **easy to maintain**. For instance, a "User Profile" feature in an application could be built as a reusable component that can be integrated into multiple pages.

2. **Powerful Tools**  
   - **Angular CLI**: Simplifies tasks like project setup, component generation, and production builds.  
   - **Built-in Routing**: Makes it easy to navigate between pages without reloading the page.  
   - **Form Handling**: Angular provides robust tools for handling forms with validation, state management, and dynamic inputs.

3. **Cross-Platform Development**  
   - Create Progressive Web Applications (PWAs) for web and mobile experiences.  
   - Build mobile and desktop applications using Angular with frameworks like **Ionic** or **Electron**.

4. **Active Community and Support**  
   Angular is backed by **Google** and boasts a **large community** of developers who contribute to its ecosystem. This ensures frequent updates, bug fixes, and a wealth of learning resources, tutorials, and libraries.

### Setting Up the Environment  

To start building Angular applications, you need to prepare your development environment. Here’s a step-by-step guide:  

#### 1. **Install Node.js**  
Node.js is essential for Angular as it provides npm (Node Package Manager) to manage dependencies.  

- **Screenshot Placeholder 1**: Show the [Node.js download page](https://nodejs.org/) highlighting the LTS version.

- Install it on your system.  
- Verify the installation using the following commands in your terminal:  

   ```bash
   node -v    # To check Node.js version
   npm -v     # To check npm version
   ```

   **Screenshot Placeholder 2**: Show a terminal screenshot of the `node -v` and `npm -v` commands with the version numbers confirming successful installation.

#### 2. **Install Angular CLI**  
The Angular Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that simplifies Angular application development. Install it globally using npm:  

   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```

   **Screenshot Placeholder 3**: Show a terminal screenshot after running `npm install -g @angular/cli`, confirming successful installation.

#### 3. **Verify Angular CLI Installation**  
After installation, confirm that Angular CLI is installed correctly by running:  

   ```bash
   ng version
   ```

   **Screenshot Placeholder 4**: Show the output of `ng version` in the terminal, displaying the Angular CLI version and other environment details.

#### 4. **Create a New Angular Application**  
To start a new project, use the following command:  

   ```bash
   ng new my-angular-app
   ```

   During the setup, Angular CLI will ask a few questions:  
- **Screenshot Placeholder 5**: Show the terminal screen with the questions asked during project creation (e.g., “Share Analytics”, “Stylesheet Format”).  

   After the project is created, navigate to your project folder:  

   ```bash
   cd my-angular-app
   ```

#### 5. **Run the Application**  
Start the development server to view your app in action:  

   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

   This command will compile the project and serve it locally.

   **Screenshot Placeholder 6**: Show the terminal output after running `ng serve`, confirming the server is running and displaying the local server URL (e.g., `http://localhost:4200`).

#### 6. **Access the Application**  
Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200). You should see the default Angular application page with the Angular logo and sample content.

   **Screenshot Placeholder 7**: Include a screenshot of the browser displaying the default Angular welcome page with the Angular logo and sample content.

### File Structure Overview  
After creating your Angular application, you will see the project’s file structure. Here’s what the essential files and folders look like:

- **src/app**: Contains the main application code, including components, services, and modules.  
- **src/assets**: Used for static files like images, fonts, or data files.  
- **src/environments**: Holds environment-specific configurations, like API URLs for development and production.

**Screenshot Placeholder 8**: Show the **src/app** folder structure in your IDE, highlighting key files like `app.component.ts`, `app.module.ts`, and `app.component.html`.
