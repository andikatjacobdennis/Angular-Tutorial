## 1. Introduction

### What is Angular?
Angular is a popular open-source framework developed by Google for building dynamic, modern web applications. It provides tools and libraries to create scalable, single-page client applications using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.

### Why Use Angular?
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Makes it easy to build reusable and modular code.
- **Powerful Tools**: Comes with a built-in CLI, routing, and form-handling capabilities.
- **Cross-Platform**: Enables building progressive web apps, mobile apps, and desktop apps.
- **Active Community and Support**: Backed by Google and a vibrant developer community.

### Setting Up the Environment
To start building Angular applications, you need to set up your development environment:
1. **Install Node.js**: Download and install the latest LTS version of Node.js from [Node.js official site](https://nodejs.org/).
   
bash
   node -v
   npm -v

   Verify the installation using the commands above.

2. **Install Angular CLI**: Use npm to globally install the Angular CLI.
   
bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli


3. **Verify Angular CLI Installation**:
   
bash
   ng version


4. **Create a New Angular Application**:
   
bash
   ng new my-angular-app
   cd my-angular-app
   ng serve


5. **Access the App**: Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200.

Youâ€™re now ready to build your first Angular app!
