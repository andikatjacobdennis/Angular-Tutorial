### Significance of angular.json in an Angular Project

The `angular.json` file is a configuration file that tells the Angular CLI how to build, serve, test, and manage your application. It acts like a guidebook for Angular's tools and commands.
Think of `angular.json` as a set of instructions for Angular CLI to run your app efficiently in different scenarios (development, testing, production). You don’t need to change it much, but knowing its purpose is essential!

### **Key Sections:**

1. **Global Settings**:
   - **`defaultProject`**: Defines the default project for commands like `ng build`.
   - **`newProjectRoot`**: Specifies where new projects are created in a multi-project setup.

2. **Project Configuration**:
   - **`projects`**: Lists all projects in the workspace (e.g., your app).
   - **`sourceRoot`**: Points to the folder with the app’s code (usually `src`).
   - **`prefix`**: Sets the prefix for component selectors (e.g., `<app-root>`).

3. **Tasks (Under `architect`)**:
   - **`build`**: Configures how the app is built (e.g., entry files, styles, assets, production settings).
   - **`serve`**: Defines how to serve the app locally during development (`ng serve`).
   - **`test`**: Sets up unit testing configuration (`ng test`).
   - **`lint`**: Configures linting (code quality checks).
   - **`e2e`**: Manages end-to-end testing settings.

4. **Environments**:
   - Supports different builds for development (`environment.ts`) and production (`environment.prod.ts`).

### **Why is `angular.json` Important?**

- It helps Angular CLI understand how to handle your app.
- You can customize builds for different environments (e.g., dev vs. prod).
- Makes it easy to manage multiple projects in the same workspace.
