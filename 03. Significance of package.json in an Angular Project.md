## 03. Significance of `package.json` in an Angular Project

The `package.json` file is a crucial part of any Angular (or Node.js-based) project. It acts as the **manifest file** for your application, providing important metadata, dependency definitions, and script commands for development, testing, and deployment.

---

### **Key Sections of `package.json`**

1. **Metadata**:
   - Contains basic information about the app, such as:
     - `name`: The name of the project (e.g., `my-angular-app`).
     - `version`: The app’s version number (e.g., `0.0.0`).

2. **Scripts**:
   - Defines commands that automate tasks like starting the development server, building the app, or running tests.
   - **Examples**:
     - `"start": "ng serve"`: Runs the Angular development server.
     - `"build": "ng build"`: Builds the application for production.
     - `"test": "ng test"`: Runs unit tests.
     - `"lint": "ng lint"`: Checks for coding standard violations.
     - `"e2e": "ng e2e"`: Runs end-to-end tests.

3. **Dependencies**:
   - **`dependencies`**:
     - Lists libraries required for the app to run in production.
     - **Examples**:
       - `@angular/core`: Angular’s core framework.
       - `rxjs`: Reactive programming library.
       - `zone.js`: Enables Angular’s change detection.
     - Angular ensures compatibility between versions of its packages using semantic versioning (e.g., `~10.0.9`).
   - **`devDependencies`**:
     - Lists tools and libraries needed during development but not in production.
     - **Examples**:
       - `@angular/cli`: Provides the Angular CLI commands.
       - `typescript`: TypeScript compiler for writing modern JavaScript.
       - `karma`: Test runner for unit tests.
       - `tslint`: Tool to enforce consistent coding style.

4. **Private**:
   - `"private": true`: Prevents the accidental publication of your app as an NPM package.

### **Why is `package.json` Important?**

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Ensures the application runs with the correct versions of libraries.
   - Simplifies the installation of dependencies using `npm install`.

2. **Automation with Scripts**:
   - Automates common tasks (e.g., starting a development server, running tests, or deploying builds).
   - Reduces manual effort and ensures consistent workflows.

3. **Version Control**:
   - Tracks the version of the app and its dependencies.
   - Enables reproducibility by locking versions via `package-lock.json`.

4. **Collaboration**:
   - Ensures all developers on a project use the same dependencies.
   - Allows new team members to set up the project with a single command: `npm install`.

5. **Custom Commands**:
   - You can add custom scripts to the `scripts` section for project-specific needs.
   - Example:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "format": "prettier --write \"src/**/*.ts\""
     }
     ```

### **How Does It Work in Angular?**

1. **During Project Setup**:
   - When you create an Angular project using the CLI (`ng new`), the `package.json` file is generated automatically.
   - It contains the default dependencies and scripts required for Angular development.

2. **During Development**:
   - `npm install`: Installs all required libraries listed in `dependencies` and `devDependencies`.
   - `npm start`: Runs the development server using `ng serve`.
   - `npm test`: Executes unit tests using tools like Karma and Jasmine.

3. **During Production**:
   - `npm run build`: Creates an optimized production build of the app.
   - The build output is free of unnecessary dev tools and libraries.
   - If your app is in `C:\git\my-angular-app` you can find the production build in `C:\git\my-angular-app\dist\my-angular-app`. To run the server go to that folder using cmd and run `ng serve`.

### **What Happens When You Run `npm install`?**

When you run the command `npm install` in your Angular project directory, Node Package Manager (NPM) downloads and installs all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file. Here's a breakdown of the process:

---

### **Where Do Dependencies Get Installed?**

1. **Installed in the `node_modules` Folder**:
   - Dependencies are downloaded into a folder named `node_modules` located in the root directory of your project.
   - This folder contains all the libraries (and their sub-dependencies) needed for your project to work.

   **Example:**
   If your `package.json` lists `@angular/core`, after running `npm install`, the directory structure might look like this:

   ```bash
   my-angular-app/
   ├── node_modules/
   │   ├── @angular/
   │   │   ├── core/
   │   │   ├── common/
   │   │   ├── router/
   │   ├── rxjs/
   │   ├── zone.js/
   ├── package.json
   ├── package-lock.json
   ```

   - The libraries are organized in a nested fashion, resolving dependencies for each library internally.

3. **Nested Dependencies**:
   - NPM also resolves and installs sub-dependencies.
   - For example:
     - If `@angular/core` depends on `rxjs`, the `rxjs` library is automatically downloaded and installed.

4. **The `package-lock.json` File**:
   - This file is automatically updated after `npm install`.
   - It locks the exact versions of all installed dependencies (including sub-dependencies), ensuring consistent behavior across different machines or environments.

5. **Global Installation (Optional)**:
   - By default, `npm install` installs packages locally (inside `node_modules` in your project folder).
   - If you use the `-g` flag (`npm install -g`), the package is installed globally on your system.
     - Global installations are typically used for command-line tools (e.g., `@angular/cli`).
     - Global packages are stored in a system-wide directory (e.g., `C:\Users\<User>\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules` on Windows or `/usr/local/lib/node_modules` on macOS/Linux).
