### **Setting Up Angular CLI**
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - **Node.js**: Install the LTS version from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org) to ensure stability.
   - Verify installation using:
     ```
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

2. **Install Angular CLI**:
   Use **npm** (Node Package Manager) to install Angular CLI globally:
   ```
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```
   - The `-g` flag ensures global installation for system-wide use.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   Check the installed Angular CLI version:
   ```
   ng version
   ```
   This also displays the versions of Node.js and npm in use.
