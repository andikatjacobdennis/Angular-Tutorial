# Angular Tutorial

## What is Angular?
Angular is a **popular open-source JavaScript/TypeScript framework** developed by Google, designed to make building **dynamic single-page applications (SPAs)** easier.

---

## **Angular: Overview**
- **Purpose**: Facilitates the development of dynamic, interactive SPAs with robust architecture and extensive features.
- **Key Features**:
  - **Two-way Data Binding**: Synchronizes the model and the view.
  - **Dependency Injection**: Simplifies the management of service dependencies.
  - **Component-Based Architecture**: Modularizes the application into reusable components.
  - **Tooling Support**: Seamless integration with tools like Angular CLI.
  - **Community**: Backed by a vibrant developer community offering support and resources.
  - **Integration**: Works well with other libraries and tools.

## **Angular CLI**
Angular CLI is a **Command Line Interface tool** that streamlines Angular application development. 

### **Key Benefits**:
- Initialize, scaffold, and maintain Angular projects effortlessly.
- Automates tasks like:
  - Running a development server for live previews.
  - Deploying the application to various environments.
  - Generating components, services, and modules.
  - Running unit tests and end-to-end (E2E) tests.
- Provides mobile app support and robust data security.

### **Setting Up Angular CLI**
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - **Node.js**: Install the LTS version from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org) to ensure stability.
   - Verify installation using:
     ```
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

2. **Install Angular CLI**:
   Use **npm** (Node Package Manager) to install Angular CLI globally:
   ```
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```
   - The `-g` flag ensures global installation for system-wide use.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   Check the installed Angular CLI version:
   ```
   ng version
   ```
   This also displays the versions of Node.js and npm in use.

## **Creating and setting up an Angular project**

### 1. **Creating a New Project**
   - **Command:** `ng new [project-name]`
   - **Options Prompted:**
     - **Angular Routing:** Allows navigation across pages/components in the app. If declined, can be added later.
     - **Stylesheet Format:** Options include CSS, SCSS, SASS, LESS, etc. You chose CSS.

---

### 2. **Project Structure**
   The Angular CLI generates a predefined structure for the project:
   - **`.vscode` folder:** Stores Visual Studio Code settings (e.g., `launch.json` for debugging).
   - **`node_modules` folder:** Contains third-party libraries and dependencies. These are bundled when the app is compiled.
   - **`public` folder:** Contains favicon.ico whic is the browser icon for the app.
   - **`src` folder:** Houses the application source code.
     - **`app` folder:** Contains components and modules, the building blocks of the Angular app.
     - **`assets` folder:** Stores resources like images, icons, and text files.
     - **`index.html`:** The entry point of the application. External styles and scripts are injected dynamically.
     - **`main.ts`:** Bootstraps the Angular app, starting with the `AppModule`.
     - **`styles.css`:** Global styles for the application.
   - **Configuration and Metadata Files:**
     - **`.editorconfig`:** Ensures consistent editor settings across team members.
     - **`.gitignore`:** Specifies files/folders to exclude from version control (e.g., `node_modules`).
     - **`angular.json`:** Project configuration for Angular CLI.
     - **`package.json`:** Defines dependencies and scripts for the project.
     - **`package-lock.json`:** Locks the specific versions of installed dependencies.
     - **`README.md`:** Provides basic documentation for the project.
     - **`tsconfig.*`:** TypeScript configuration files.

---

### 3. **Running the Project**
   - **Command:** `ng serve`
   - **Outcome:**
     - Starts a development server on `http://localhost:4200`.
     - Opens the default browser with the initial Angular app view.

## 4. **Introduction to Angular 17**

Angular 17 brings a wealth of improvements to the table, including a cleaner syntax, performance enhancements, and a more intuitive approach to common tasks. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced Angular developer, these updates are designed to streamline development and deliver better applications faster. Here’s a breakdown of Angular 17’s key features:

---

### **1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**

**What is SSR?**  
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique where Angular applications are pre-rendered on the server before being delivered to the client. This helps improve SEO, reduces the time-to-first-contentful-paint, and enhances performance on slower devices.

**Getting Started with SSR:**  
Creating an SSR-enabled Angular application is now as simple as:  
```bash
ng new myApp --ssr
```
This command generates an application pre-configured with Angular Universal, ready to take advantage of SSR.

---

### **2. New `if-else` Directive Syntax**

Angular 17 introduces the `@if` directive, making conditional rendering easier to read and write.

**Before (using `*ngIf`):**  
```html
<div *ngIf="loggedIn; else randomUser">
  The user is logged in.
</div>
<ng-template #randomUser>
  The user is not logged in.
</ng-template>
```

**After Angular 17 (using `@if`):**  
```html
@if (loggedIn) {
  The user is logged in.
} @else {
  The user is not logged in.
}
```

This new syntax is more concise and provides a clearer structure.

---

### **3. New `for` Directive Syntax**

The `*ngFor` directive has been replaced with the `@for` directive, which is more intuitive and includes built-in support for handling empty lists.

**Before (using `*ngFor`):**  
```html
<ng-container *ngFor="let user of users; trackBy: trackById">
  {{ user.name }}
</ng-container>
<ng-container *ngIf="users.length === 0">
  Empty list of users.
</ng-container>
```

**After Angular 17 (using `@for`):**  
```html
@for (user of users; track user.id) {
  <p>{{ user.name }}</p>
} @empty {
  <p>Empty list of users</p>
}
```

This streamlined approach reduces boilerplate and improves readability.

---

### **4. New `switch` Directive Syntax**

Angular 17 enhances the `switch` directive with a new syntax that simplifies the handling of multiple cases and defaults.

**Before (using `*ngSwitch`):**  
```html
<div [ngSwitch]="accessLevel">
  <admin *ngSwitchCase="'admin'"></admin>
  <moderator *ngSwitchCase="'moderator'"></moderator>
  <user *ngSwitchDefault></user>
</div>
```

**After Angular 17 (using `@switch`):**  
```html
@switch (accessLevel) {
  @case ('admin') { <admin /> }
  @case ('moderator') { <moderator /> }
  @default { <user /> }
}
```

This change makes `switch` statements more concise and easier to manage.

### **5. Differable Views**

**What Are Differable Views?**  
Differable Views is Angular 17's new approach to lazy-loading components and modules. It allows views to load only when specific user interactions occur, boosting application performance.

**Before Angular 17 (manual lazy-loading):**  
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'users',
    loadChildren: () =>
      import('./users/users.module').then((m) => m.UsersModule),
  },
];
```

**After Angular 17 (interaction-driven lazy-loading):**  
```html
<button #loadButton>Click Me</button>

@interaction(loadButton) {
  <app-componentName />
  <p>Loading...</p>
} @error {
  <p>Error loading the component.</p>
} @loaded {
  <p>Component successfully loaded!</p>
}
```

**Explanation:**  
- **`@interaction(loadButton)`**: Defers the loading of the component until the button is clicked.  
- **`@error`**: Handles any errors that occur during the loading process.  
- **`@loaded`**: Provides feedback when the component loads successfully.  

This new syntax simplifies lazy-loading, making it declarative and easier to implement.
