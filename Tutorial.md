- Automates tasks like:
  - Running a development server for live previews.
  - Deploying the application to various environments.
  - Generating components, services, and modules.
  - Running unit tests and end-to-end (E2E) tests.
- Provides mobile app support and robust data security.

---

### **Setting Up Angular CLI**
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - **Node.js**: Install the LTS version from [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org) to ensure stability.
   - Verify installation using:
     ```
     node -v
     npm -v
     ```

2. **Install Angular CLI**:
   Use **npm** (Node Package Manager) to install Angular CLI globally:
   ```
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```
   - The `-g` flag ensures global installation for system-wide use.

3. **Verify Installation**:
   Check the installed Angular CLI version:
   ```
   ng version
   ```
   This also displays the versions of Node.js and npm in use.

## **Creating and setting up an Angular project**

### 1. **Creating a New Project**
   - **Command:** `ng new [project-name]`
   - **Options Prompted:**
     - **Angular Routing:** Allows navigation across pages/components in the app. If declined, can be added later.
     - **Stylesheet Format:** Options include CSS, SCSS, SASS, LESS, etc. You chose CSS.

---

### 2. **Project Structure**
   The Angular CLI generates a predefined structure for the project:
   - **`.vscode` folder:** Stores Visual Studio Code settings (e.g., `launch.json` for debugging).
   - **`node_modules` folder:** Contains third-party libraries and dependencies. These are bundled when the app is compiled.
   - **`public` folder:** Contains favicon.ico whic is the browser icon for the app.
   - **`src` folder:** Houses the application source code.
     - **`app` folder:** Contains components and modules, the building blocks of the Angular app.
     - **`assets` folder:** Stores resources like images, icons, and text files.
     - **`index.html`:** The entry point of the application. External styles and scripts are injected dynamically.
     - **`main.ts`:** Bootstraps the Angular app, starting with the `AppModule`.
     - **`styles.css`:** Global styles for the application.
   - **Configuration and Metadata Files:**
     - **`.editorconfig`:** Ensures consistent editor settings across team members.
     - **`.gitignore`:** Specifies files/folders to exclude from version control (e.g., `node_modules`).
     - **`angular.json`:** Project configuration for Angular CLI.
     - **`package.json`:** Defines dependencies and scripts for the project.
     - **`package-lock.json`:** Locks the specific versions of installed dependencies.
     - **`README.md`:** Provides basic documentation for the project.
     - **`tsconfig.*`:** TypeScript configuration files.

---

### 3. **Running the Project**
   - **Command:** `ng serve`
   - **Outcome:**
     - Starts a development server on `http://localhost:4200`.
     - Opens the default browser with the initial Angular app view.

## 4. **Introduction to Angular 17**

Angular 17 brings a wealth of improvements to the table, including a cleaner syntax, performance enhancements, and a more intuitive approach to common tasks. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced Angular developer, these updates are designed to streamline development and deliver better applications faster. Here’s a breakdown of Angular 17’s key features:

---

### **1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**

**What is SSR?**  
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique where Angular applications are pre-rendered on the server before being delivered to the client. This helps improve SEO, reduces the time-to-first-contentful-paint, and enhances performance on slower devices.

**Getting Started with SSR:**  
Creating an SSR-enabled Angular application is now as simple as:  
```bash
ng new myApp --ssr
```

---

### **2. New `if-else` Directive Syntax**

Angular 17 introduces the `@if` directive, making conditional rendering easier to read and write.

**Before (using `*ngIf`):**  
```html
<div *ngIf="loggedIn; else randomUser">
  The user is logged in.
</div>
<ng-template #randomUser>
  The user is not logged in.
</ng-template>
```

**After Angular 17 (using `@if`):**  
```html
@if (loggedIn) {
  The user is logged in.
} @else {
  The user is not logged in.
}
```

This new syntax is more concise and provides a clearer structure.

---

### **3. New `for` Directive Syntax**

The `*ngFor` directive has been replaced with the `@for` directive, which is more intuitive and includes built-in support for handling empty lists.

**Before (using `*ngFor`):**  
```html
<ng-container *ngFor="let user of users; trackBy: trackById">
  {{ user.name }}
</ng-container>
<ng-container *ngIf="users.length === 0">
  Empty list of users.
</ng-container>
```

**After Angular 17 (using `@for`):**  
```html
@for (user of users; track user.id) {
  <p>{{ user.name }}</p>
} @empty {
  <p>Empty list of users</p>
}
```

This streamlined approach reduces boilerplate and improves readability.

---

### **4. New `switch` Directive Syntax**

Angular 17 enhances the `switch` directive with a new syntax that simplifies the handling of multiple cases and defaults.

**Before (using `*ngSwitch`):**  
```html
<div [ngSwitch]="accessLevel">
  <admin *ngSwitchCase="'admin'"></admin>
  <moderator *ngSwitchCase="'moderator'"></moderator>
  <user *ngSwitchDefault></user>
</div>
```

**After Angular 17 (using `@switch`):**  
```html
@switch (accessLevel) {
  @case ('admin') { <admin /> }
  @case ('moderator') { <moderator /> }
  @default { <user /> }
}
```

This change makes `switch` statements more concise and easier to manage.

---

### **5. Differable Views**

**What Are Differable Views?**  
Differable Views is Angular 17's new approach to lazy-loading components and modules. It allows views to load only when specific user interactions occur, boosting application performance.

**Before Angular 17 (manual lazy-loading):**  
```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  {
    path: 'users',
    loadChildren: () =>
      import('./users/users.module').then((m) => m.UsersModule),
  },
];
```

**After Angular 17 (interaction-driven lazy-loading):**  
```html
<button #loadButton>Click Me</button>

@interaction(loadButton) {
  <app-componentName />
  <p>Loading...</p>
} @error {
  <p>Error loading the component.</p>
} @loaded {
  <p>Component successfully loaded!</p>
}
```

**Explanation:**  
- **`@interaction(loadButton)`**: Defers the loading of the component until the button is clicked.  
- **`@error`**: Handles any errors that occur during the loading process.  
- **`@loaded`**: Provides feedback when the component loads successfully.  

This new syntax simplifies lazy-loading, making it declarative and easier to implement.

### **6. More Stable Signals**
### **7. Better Build Performance**

## 5. **Two-Way Binding**:
   Two-way data binding in Angular allows a dynamic link between the component’s property and the UI. When you use `[(ngModel)]`, any changes in the input field are automatically reflected in the component, and any changes to the component property are reflected in the UI.

 ### Example:
 ```html
 <label>Name: </label>
 <input [(ngModel)]="name" placeholder="Enter your name" />

 <p>Your name is: {{ name }}</p>
 ```

 ### How It Works:
 - **`[(ngModel)]`:** The square brackets `[ ]` are for property binding, and the parentheses `( )` are for event binding. Together, `[(ngModel)]` binds the input field to the `name` property in your component.
 - **Dynamic Updates:** When you type something in the input field, it updates the `name` property in the component, which in turn updates wherever `{{ name }}` is used in the template.

 ### Prerequisites:
 - Import `FormsModule` into your module or include it in the `imports` array if you're using a standalone component.

 ```typescript
 import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';

 @Component({
   selector: 'app-root',
   imports: [FormsModule], // Include FormsModule here
   templateUrl: './app.component.html',
   styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
 })
 export class AppComponent {
   name: string = ''; // Property to bind
 }
 ```

 ### Outcome:
 When a user enters their name in the input field, the `name` value updates dynamically, and the updated value is displayed immediately in the `<p>Your name is: {{ name }}</p>`.

## 6. **Migrating to Angular 17**

Migrating an Angular application to version 17 involves several steps to ensure the project is updated with the latest Angular CLI, core libraries, and syntax enhancements. Below is a structured guide to help you migrate your project effectively:

---

### 1. **Verify the Current Angular Version**
Before starting the migration, check the current version of Angular in your project by examining the `package.json` file. Look for the `@angular/core` and `@angular/cli` entries.

```json
"dependencies": {
  "@angular/core": "^16.0.0"
},
"devDependencies": {
  "@angular/cli": "^16.0.0"
}
```

This indicates the project is running Angular 16.

---

### 2. **Update Angular CLI and Core**
To upgrade Angular CLI and Core to the latest version (Angular 17), run the following command:

```bash
ng update @angular/cli @angular/core --allow-dirty
```

The `--allow-dirty` flag allows the update process to proceed even if there are uncommitted changes in your Git repository. Ensure you review and commit changes after the update.

Once the command completes, the Angular CLI and Core libraries will be updated to the latest version.

---

### 3. **Verify the Update**
After updating, verify the Angular version by running:

```bash
ng version
```

You should see Angular 17 listed in the output.

---

### 4. **Update Code Syntax to Angular 17**
Angular 17 introduces new control flow statements that simplify templates, replacing directives like `*ngIf` and `*ngFor` with `@if` and `@for`. To migrate your existing templates to the new syntax, run:

```bash
ng generate @angular/core:control-flow
```

This command will:
1. Prompt you to define the path for migration. By default, it uses the root path.
2. Ask if you want to refactor templates. Respond with "yes" to proceed.

For example, the following code:
```html
<div *ngIf="isVisible">Visible Content</div>
<ul>
  <li *ngFor="let item of items">{{ item }}</li>
</ul>
```

Will be refactored to:
```html
@if (isVisible) {
  <div>Visible Content</div>
}
<ul>
  @for (let item of items) {
    <li>{{ item }}</li>
  }
</ul>
```

---

### 5. **Test the Application**
After migration, test the application thoroughly to ensure that the updates did not introduce any breaking changes. Run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Address any issues or deprecations highlighted in the terminal output or browser console.

---

### 6. **Explore New Features**
Angular 17 introduces several new features and performance improvements. Consider exploring the official Angular documentation or dedicated tutorials to understand and integrate these features into your application.
