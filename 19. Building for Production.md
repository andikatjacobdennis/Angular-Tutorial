## 19. Building for Production

When developing Angular applications, the next step after building and testing is to prepare the application for deployment. Angular provides a command that optimizes the application for production environments, improving performance and security. In this tutorial, we'll walk through the steps involved in building an Angular application for production.

---

### **Step 1: Preparing for Production Build**

#### **1.1. Understanding the Angular Production Build**

When you build an Angular app for production, Angular optimizes the code by:

1. **Minification**: Reduces the size of the JavaScript files by removing unnecessary whitespace and shortening variable names.
2. **Tree Shaking**: Removes unused code from the final bundle.
3. **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation**: Pre-compiles templates and components during build time rather than at runtime, leading to faster rendering in the browser.
4. **Lazy Loading**: Optimizes load times by loading modules only when needed, rather than loading all modules upfront.
5. **Source Map Generation**: Optional in production; can be disabled to reduce bundle size.

The production build uses the `--prod` flag with the `ng build` command, enabling the optimizations mentioned above.

---

### **Step 2: Build the Application for Production**

#### **2.1. Build Command**

To build the Angular application for production, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ng build --prod
```

This command will:

- Generate the production-ready code inside the `dist/` directory.
- Minify and optimize the code for production.
- Perform AOT compilation.
- Enable tree-shaking to remove unused code.
- Generate smaller bundles for faster loading.

The output will look something like this:

```
✔ Browser application bundle generation complete.
✔ Copying assets complete.
✔ Index html generation complete.

Initial Chunk Files | Names | Size
vendor.js | vendor | 3 MB
main.js | main | 200 KB
styles.css | styles | 10 KB
```

After the build is completed, the production files will be located inside the `dist/` folder, typically under `dist/your-app-name/`.

#### **2.2. Build Output**

In the `dist/` folder, you will see several files:

1. **main.js**: The main bundle containing your application code.
2. **vendor.js**: Contains the third-party libraries used by the application (like Angular core, RxJS, etc.).
3. **styles.css**: The global styles for the application.
4. **index.html**: The HTML file used to serve the app in production.

#### **2.3. Additional Configuration Options**

You can also configure build options in the `angular.json` file. For example, you may want to include specific environments, define API URLs, or change optimization settings.

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "your-app": {
      "architect": {
        "build": {
          "configurations": {
            "production": {
              "fileReplacements": [
                {
                  "replace": "src/environments/environment.ts",
                  "with": "src/environments/environment.prod.ts"
                }
              ],
              "optimization": true,
              "sourceMap": false,
              "extractCss": true,
              "namedChunks": false,
              "aot": true,
              "extractLicenses": true
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In this configuration:

- **fileReplacements**: Replaces `environment.ts` with `environment.prod.ts` for production-specific configurations.
- **optimization**: Enables minification and bundling optimizations.
- **sourceMap**: Set to `false` to disable source maps for production.
- **extractCss**: Extracts CSS into separate files.
- **aot**: Enables Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation.
- **extractLicenses**: Extracts third-party license information into a separate file.

---

### **Step 3: Environment Configuration**

Angular uses environment-specific files for configuration purposes. By default, there are two environment files:

- **src/environments/environment.ts**: Used for development.
- **src/environments/environment.prod.ts**: Used for production.

You can define environment-specific variables in these files, such as API URLs, debug flags, or feature toggles.

#### **3.1. Example of `environment.ts` and `environment.prod.ts`**

##### `environment.ts` (for development):

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'https://dev-api.example.com',
  debug: true
};
```

##### `environment.prod.ts` (for production):

```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: true,
  apiUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
  debug: false
};
```

When you build the app for production using the `ng build --prod` command, Angular automatically replaces `environment.ts` with `environment.prod.ts`.

---

### **Step 4: Enabling Lazy Loading (Optional)**

Lazy loading is an optimization technique that allows you to load modules only when needed, reducing the initial bundle size.

#### **4.1. Setting Up Lazy Loading**

Suppose you have two feature modules, `HomeModule` and `AboutModule`. Instead of loading both modules at once, you can configure lazy loading to load the `AboutModule` only when the user navigates to the `/about` route.

##### Step 1: Define the Routes

In your `app-routing.module.ts`, configure lazy loading for the `AboutModule`.

```typescript
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'about', loadChildren: () => import('./about/about.module').then(m => m.AboutModule) },
];
```

This will ensure that the `AboutModule` is only loaded when the user navigates to the `/about` route.

##### Step 2: Set Up the `AboutModule`

In the `about.module.ts`, create the module as usual.

```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [AboutComponent],
  imports: [CommonModule]
})
export class AboutModule {}
```

With lazy loading, Angular will split the app into smaller bundles, loading only the necessary code when a user navigates to the relevant route.

### **Step 5: Testing the Production Build Locally**

Before deploying your application, it's a good idea to test the production build locally.

You can use a simple static server like `http-server` to serve the contents of the `dist/` folder. First, install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

Then, navigate to the `dist/your-app-name` folder and run the following command:

```bash
http-server -p 8080
```

Now, open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser to check the production version of the application.

---

### **Step 6: Deploying the Application**

Once you have built the application for production, you can deploy it to any server or hosting provider. Some popular hosting options for Angular applications include:

- **Firebase Hosting**: Simple and fast, integrates well with Angular.
- **Netlify**: Provides a serverless platform to deploy Angular apps.
- **AWS S3**: Use Amazon S3 to serve static Angular files.
- **Heroku**: Can also be used for deploying Angular apps with a Node.js backend.

To deploy your application, you need to upload the files from the `dist/` folder to your chosen hosting platform.

### **Step 7: Monitoring and Optimizing the Production Build**

After deploying your application, it’s essential to monitor and optimize its performance.

#### **7.1. Performance Audits with Lighthouse**

You can use **Google Lighthouse** (available in Chrome DevTools) to run performance audits on your Angular app. It provides suggestions for improving page load speed, accessibility, SEO, and more.

1. Open DevTools in Chrome (`Ctrl+Shift+I`).
2. Go to the **Lighthouse** tab.
3. Run a performance audit to see how well your app performs in production and get suggestions on optimization.

#### **7.2. Optimizing Bundle Size**

To further optimize your Angular app, consider:

- **Differential Loading**: Angular uses differential loading to serve modern JavaScript to supported browsers and legacy JavaScript to older browsers.
- **Code Splitting**: With lazy loading and dynamic imports, you can split your code into smaller chunks and load only the necessary parts.
- **Compression**: Use gzip or Brotli compression to reduce the size of assets sent over the network.
